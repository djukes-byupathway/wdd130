        <p>Hi, I am David. I am a student at BYU-Pathways and I am learning web development. I hope
            to get good at this during the course of our studies, but am feeling a bit tentative
            right now. I am lucky to be married to my amazing wife Amy. Together we have 6 beautiful
            children.
            Jorie is our eldest, followed by Lindsey, Xavier, Eleanor, Lillian, and finally Harry.
        </p>

        <p>
            The youngest four children in our family take after their father and wrestle. We have
            had a
            high school state runner up, multiple hs state qualifiers, middle school state champs,
            and other
            accolades. Some joke that it has become the family business.
            We also enjoy spending time outdoors and our standing summer vacation plans include
            spending a
            week in the Michigan wilderness with family.
        </p>
        <p>
            Looking forward to getting this stuff figured out.
        </p>
